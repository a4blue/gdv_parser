# GDV-Parser
Just fooling around with the [GDV Format](http://www.gdv-online.de/vuvm/bestand/best_2018.htm)
## Goals
Besides refreshing my Rust Skills:
1. Read the example GDV File (test.gdv) and parse it to a Rust Structure
2. Read GDV File from different Character Encodings
3. Export the Structure as JSON
4. Export the Structure as XML
## Build
```
cargo build --release
```
